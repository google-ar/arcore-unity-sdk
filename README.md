Google ARCore SDK for Unity
===========================
Copyright 2017 Google LLC

This SDK provides native APIs for all of the essential AR features like motion
tracking, environmental understanding, and light estimation. With these
capabilities you can build entirely new AR experiences or enhance existing apps
with AR features.

<b>Caution</b>: The <i>ARCore SDK for Unity</i> is <b>deprecated</b>, and no longer
supported in the 2020 and later versions of Unity. This SDK should only be
used by developers working on existing projects which are unable to migrate
to Unity's AR Foundation. Developers starting new projects should instead use
the [ARCore Extensions for AR Foundation](//github.com/google-ar/arcore-unity-extensions).

## Quick Start

## Release Notes

The SDK release notes are available on the
[releases](//github.com/google-ar/arcore-unity-sdk/releases) page.


## Terms & Conditions

By downloading the ARCore SDK for Unity, you agree that the
[Google APIs Terms of Service](//developers.google.com/terms/) governs your use
thereof.


## User privacy requirements

You must disclose the use of Google Play Services for AR (ARCore) and how it
collects and processes data, prominently in your application, easily accessible
to users. You can do this by adding the following text on your main menu or
notice screen: "This application runs on [Google Play Services for AR](//play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.ar.core) (ARCore),

## Deprecation policy

Apps built with **ARCore SDK 1.12.0 or higher** are covered by the
[Cloud Anchor API deprecation policy](//developers.google.com/ar/distribute/deprecation-policy).

Apps built with **ARCore SDK 1.11.0 or lower** will be unable to host or resolve
Cloud Anchors beginning December 2020 due to the SDK's use of an older,
deprecated ARCore Cloud Anchor service.
